# Quantum-Circuits
This Jupyter notebook provides a visual and conceptual introduction to quantum circuits, focusing on the structure and functionality of quantum gates, wires, registers, and how quantum algorithms are visualized in circuit form.

**Note**: This notebook includes diagrams sourced from PennyLane’s Codebook: https://pennylane.ai/codebook/introduction-to-quantum-computing/quantum-circuits

## Content

The notebook explores:

- Visualizing Quantum Algorithms
  The role of circuits in representing quantum computations.

- Fundamental units
  Introducing some essential concepts such as wires, quantum register, and circuit depths

- Circuit diagram
  A look at how qubits are organized and depicted in circuits.

- Quantum Gates
  Exploring how gates acting on qubits can be executed simultaneously.

- QNodes and Devices
  Explaining how to bind the circuit to a device, and how to run and execute the circuit

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of qubits
