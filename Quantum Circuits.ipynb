    "Understanding qubits and their mathematical representations is one of the most important steps to discuss how quantum computations are expressed. Through the quantum computations, we can manipulate and measure these qubits in a meaningful way. However, we need to find a way to express quantum algorithms and protocols in order to understand these relations and representations without any particular hardware or programming language. We achieve this by **quantum circuits**.\n",

We can think of quantum circuits as a set of instructions that tell what and when to do to the qubits. Performing particular operations in a certain way, we can run different algorithms. \n",
